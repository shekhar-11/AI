The lemmatization refers to reducing the word to its root word . Its similar to stemming, the only difference is that the stemming reduces to root stem , 
while the lemmatization reduces to root word.
The output we get is called lemma.
After this we get the correct word that means the same thing (unlike in stemming where for historical we get histori)

NLTK provides WordNetLemmatizer class

This class uses morphy() function  to the WordNetCorpusReader class to find lemma


# lemmatizer.lemmatize(word,pos)
# #pos ===>
# Noun- n
# verb - v
# adverb = r
# adjective = a



NOTE- ---- The wordnet lemmizer compares with the wordnet corpus so it takes time to compare if large number of words are there
Used in  ------- QnA , Chatbots , Text Summarization


#few words like consistently hasn't been defined in it so spaCy is needed (consider word net corpus is limited words dictionary )
